                <h2 id="section1">The sorts of things bored kids do</h2>

                <p>
                    Growing up as a young lad, I was often taken to parties
                    and meetings which I felt had nothing to do with me.  For
                    one, there weren't many kids my age at those parties; my
                    family immigrated to the United States fairly early among
                    our diaspora, so I was slightly older than most of the
                    other kids.  Besides, all these gatherings were the same
                    from my point of view: loud music (if it was a party),
                    grown-ups talking about local politics (if it wasn't), and
                    nothing entertaining to do either way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But that was fine; I have a brother two years younger than
                    me, and he was dragged to the same functions for the same
                    reasons.  As siblings often do in trying situations such as
                    these, we made our own fun.  But no running around and
                    chasing each other in circles for <em>us</em>;
                    besides being expressly forbidden at these venues, we
                    preferred more intellectual styles of play.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus at some point we made sure to always surreptitiously
                    sneak a few pieces of blank paper into these venues.
                    Paper's good for all sorts of things: there was drawing,
                    of course; pencil-and-paper games (to this day, I remain
                    an <strong>expert</strong> at Tic-Tac-Toe);
                    and when you were done writing on both sides, you could
                    always fold the sheets into paper airplanes or the like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That continued for a little while.  But things changed
                    when we plucked a handful of dice from our <em>Parcheesi</em>
                    and <em>Ludo</em> boards and secreted them into these
                    facilities.  Our play had suddenly gained <strong>dimensions</strong> of
                    nuance!  But what was there that we could do with these
                    raw materials?
                </p>

                     alt="A picture of a giant attack robot smashing buildings and firing into the air.  A large logo behind it says 'MECHWARRIOR'."
                     title="Splash screen from the old 1989 DOS MechWarrior game." />
                <p>
                    In the late 80s and early 90s, the table-top game
                    Battletech/MechWarrior began to come into its own as a
                    cultural phenomenon.  In short, it was a game about future
                    humans colonizing the galaxy, but <em>who
                    cares about that since they're pummeling one another with
                    giant attack robots.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I never played the official game itself (and still
                    haven't), I followed the stories of the <em>Inner Sphere</em> and the <em>Steiner-Davions</em> with
                    more than a passing enthusiasm.  We had a couple of novels
                    set in that universe which we read and re-read (mostly
                    because of the fanciful <abbr title="Battlemech, the nickname for the aforementioned giant attack robots">mech</abbr>
                    <a href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Category:Works_by_Duane_Loose">illustrations</a>
                    in the back of the books.)  I even recall a short-lived
                    cartoon being created at some point and never coming to a
                    satisfactory conclusion&mdash;just like most other late
                    80s, early 90s cartoons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By now, you can perhaps see where I am going with this: I
                    invented a new paper-and pencil game <em>very</em> loosely
                    based on the MechWarrior stories I loved.  A game where
                    players would roll dice to attack each other and mark the
                    results on the paper.
                </p>

                <p>I called that game "<strong>Bot</strong>."</p>

                <h2 id="section3">"Want to play again?"</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Bot was not a video game.</strong>  It could be
                    played anytime, anywhere, with just a piece of paper, a
                    pencil, some dice (the more, the merrier), and at least
                    two minds.  One started by agreeing on the hitpoints and
                    weapons that the available 'Bots for both players should have&mdash;for
                    instance, a <em>Locust</em> might use two dice to attack,
                    no dice to defend, and have 10 hitpoints.  Since this was
                    a fairly weak 'Bot, we'd mutually agree to assign it a low
                    "score" of (say) 5 points.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Players agree beforehand on a limit for their total 'Bot scores&mdash;their <em>budget</em>,
                    more or less&mdash;and then "purchase" as many 'Bots as
                    they can with the budget allotted by writing them on their
                    side of the sheet.  Then the game begins!  One by one,
                    each player selects their next available 'Bot, selects a
                    target enemy Bot, and rolls dice to determine how much the
                    one wallops the other.  Repeat until dead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some easy variations arose to break the monotony: bigger
                    'Bots would roll an armor die to prevent some incoming
                    damage, while other smaller 'Bots might be equipped with
                    "jump thrusters", allowing them to completely bypass an
                    attack by rolling an even number on a die.  Bots might
                    have a variety of weapons to choose from with different
                    attack formulae, and my brother and I would carefully
                    select the weapon that seemed most likely to deal the
                    finising blow in a given situation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like all things, we grew weary of even this game after a
                    while and moved on, but for those couple of years in the
                    early 90s, Bot was our go-to means of evading
                    boredom...provided our parents didn't hear us quietly
                    rolling dice at parties and move to confiscate them, which
                    happened a number of times.  For some reason, we were
                    always able to find more dice.
                </p>

                <h2 id="section4">So you're telling me that this whole thing is just math.</h2>

                <p>
                    Well, yeah.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Obviously, without the ability to move the 'Bots in any
                    way, this is strictly a game of probabalistic likelihoods
                    and subtraction&mdash;those are definitely math, so that's
                    what this game is, too.  But it is my hope that with these
                    improved graphics and special effects, the game won't <em>feel</em> like
                    it's just a math game, and that you will derive a sense of
                    satisfaction from successfully walloping the bad guy's
                    giant attack robots.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also used a number of open-source tools to create this
                    project.  Worthy of particular mention are the
                    <a href="https://www.gimp.org"><abbr title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</abbr></a>,
                    an all-around image manipulator, and <a href="http://www.antiprism.com">Antiprism</a>,
                    which I used to generate the polyhedral dice images.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  I
                    hope you have as much fun playing as I had reminiscing.
